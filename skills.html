            Hello, my name is Charlie and I'm currently looking for part-time or full-employment. I'm a driven individual, with a lot to gain, and I'm looking for an employer that's keen to put me to the test and give me the opportunity to prove my worth. I currently live in Longstanton. (Cambridgeshire)
        <br>
            Since January this year (2022) I have been studying the basic concepts and principles of interactive web development, starting with html and CSS, before moving into JavaScript. I believe we are also going to take a look at react before the end of the "Skills Bootcamp" that I have been studying with.
        
        <br>
        <br>
            Whilst studying I have learned about Github and Visual studio code use.
        <br>
            We then progressed onto defining elements on the page in html,
            before then progressing onto manipulating the visual appearance and layout of these elements using CSS. html and CSS appears relatively straight forward to me and I believe that with consistent use I can master it.
        <br>
        <br>
            
        <br> 
            What I can bring to the Team.
        <br>
            I value myself as a Team player and I'm always looking for cohesion and unity within a group. 
        <br> 
            I'm literate, and have strong people skills which I feel makes both teamwork, and communication with the public/clients/other businesses, an area that I excel in.
        <br>
        <br>
        
            As an employee my focus's would be primarily on these efforts:<br>
            Punctuality<br>
            Efficiency<br>
            Etiquette<br>
            And generally trying to achieve the job to hand, to the highest standard possible, via the path of least resistance (the easiest, most logical, way).
